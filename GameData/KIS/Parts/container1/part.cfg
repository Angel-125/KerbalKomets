Two days before launch, the ground crew discovered that there was no more room for Valentina's favorite koffee mug. This put the entire mission at risk! Our engineers were thankfully able to solve the problem by attaching an ordinary hiking backpack reinforced with aluminum tubing to the exterior of the ship. Crews liked this design so much that these container-backpacks are now mass-produced.
