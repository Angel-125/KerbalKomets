Our engineers took this report very seriously. After performing extensive research, numerous experiments, and consuming several gallons of koffee, the problem was diagnosed, and a simple, yet elegant solution was found: a wrench! Now Jeb can fix all those loose parts, or even attach additional struts mid-flight.
