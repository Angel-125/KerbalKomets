Jeb, in particular, complained: "This isn't what I wanted! What's next, a screwdriver!?". Again, our engineers took this report very seriously. After a year of R&D and five unsuccessful prototypes (one even causing a fire at the launch pad), we present a new product: an ELECTRIC screwdriver. Despite the name, screws are actually not yet supported, but bolts and nuts of any size are compatible. Besides, Jeb got exactly what he wanted!
