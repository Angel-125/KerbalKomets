Nonetheless, our trained pilots and engineers are capable of using this explosive device to dispose of unnecessary parts or de-orbit a satellite. Keep in mind that there is a limited time to reach a safe distance before it explodes! Monthly training sessions are held to ensure our crew are well aware of all relevant safety regulations.
