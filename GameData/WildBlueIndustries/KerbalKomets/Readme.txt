Kerbal Komets

Turn asteroids into komets and explore them!

---Installation---
Copy the contents of the zip file to your GameData directory. Be sure to overwrite existing files and replace them.

Community Resource Pack is optional; if installed, your komets will have other resources in addition to Ore.

---REVISION HISTORY---

0.3.5
- Existing asteroids won't change shape when you install or uninstall the mod.
NOTE: If you've installed Kerbal Komets before, and visited an asteroid/komet, then its size and shape will change, but that will be the last time it does so.

- Reduced chances of spawning a komet.
- Komets now spawn with Kopernicus installed.
- If you manually flip an asteroid to a komet, its orbit will remain unchanged.
- Re-labeled the "Rename Asteroid" button to "Rename Komet" when the asteroid becomes a komet.

0.1.0
- Initial release
