	RESULTS
	{
		default = As the icy body approaches the sun, its surface warms and outgasses water vapor.
		default = Solar wind and radiation strip away the komet's atmosphere and forms a long tail.
		default = The komet is an amalgramation of rock, ore, water ice, and frozen gases.
		default = The komet appears to contain organic compounds. Perhaps the foundations of life arrived on a komet?
		default = In a few centuries, this komet will lose all of its water ices and gases and become an extinct komet.
		default = The high concentration of ice might be useful someday.
		default = The komet's tail, known as a coma, is illuminated by sunlight reflecting upon dust particles, and through ionization of the water vapor.
		default = As solar radiation strikes the komet's atmosphere, the radiation steals electrons in a process called "charged exchange." This process generates X-rays.
		default = Uneven heating of the komet creates jets that can cause a komet to tumble.
		default = Komets are theorized to originate from either the Oort cloud, though some komets appear to originate from beyond the solar system.
		default = Results suggest that the famed astronomers Scott and Manley Kerman might have a lot more to say about komets.
